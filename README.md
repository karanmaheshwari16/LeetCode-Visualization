# LeetCode Visualization
LeetCode Visualization is an interactive tool designed to help users understand how solutions to LeetCode problems work. Users can input their own examples and observe how the code operates through diagrams, charts, and interactive visualizations. This tool offers a hands-on way to grasp complex algorithms and data structures visually.

# Features
- Interactive Visualizations: Users can input their own examples to see how the code processes them step by step.
- Diagrams & Charts: Visual representations of algorithms and data structures to make the learning experience more intuitive.
- Real-time Feedback: As users modify their input, the corresponding visualizations update in real-time.
- LeetCode Problem Support: Works for a variety of LeetCode problems, helping users understand solutions at a deeper level.
  
# How It Works
- Select a LeetCode problem.
- Input your own example/test case.
- Visualize the steps of the algorithm through dynamic diagrams and charts.
- Observe how the data structure evolves as the code executes.
